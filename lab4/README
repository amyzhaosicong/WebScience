Lab 4 - Mobile App
Name: Sicong Zhao
RCS: zhaos4

Notes:
Used jQuery mobile to create a mobile version of Tweet ticker from Lab1, and read data from twitter API. 
( The authentication part was learnt from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQaPt-gQVRI, which downloaded the tweets_json.php file and tmhOAuth.php file, and adjusted them due to current situation.) 
Finally, used CSS Media Queries to make the page responsive when the screen is less than 600px and 400px.

TA: Ahmed Eleish; Classmates: Luying Wen, Taoran Li (Tom)
